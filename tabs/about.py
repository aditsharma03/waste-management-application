        Efficient waste segregation is the first step towards responsible waste management. By categorizing waste into distinct types such as recyclables, organic matter, and non-recyclables, we can significantly reduce environmental impact and contribute to a cleaner, healthier planet.

        Our mission is to raise awareness about the importance of waste segregation and provide a user-friendly platform for predicting the appropriate disposal category of various items. By integrating technology with eco-conscious practices, we hope to inspire positive change and foster a sustainable mindset.
